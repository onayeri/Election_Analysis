---
##Project Overview
This project allowed me to use Python syntax through visual editor to compile and summarize the dat from an election. The election dataset consisted of three different candidates with votes across three different counties. Compiling this data using Python alllowed for me to see the results of each of these candidates for each city. 
* 1. Get the total number of election votes 
* 2. Extract the county votes for each candidate along with each candidates overall percentage of county votes
* 3. Get the name of the city with the largest turout along with the individual candidates percentage of votes from that county's turnout
*4 Determine the winner, winnning vote count, and the winning percentage
