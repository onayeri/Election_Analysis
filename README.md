# Election_Analysis
---
## Project Overview
This project allowed me to use Python syntax through visual editor to compile and summarize the dat from an election. The election dataset consisted of three different candidates with votes across three different counties. Compiling this data using Python alllowed for me to see the results of each of these candidates for each city along with the winning count and cadidate.
#### Step By Step Goals
* 1. Get the total number of election votes 
* 2. Extract the county votes for each candidate along with each candidates overall percentage of county votes
* 3. Get the name of the city with the largest turout along with the individual candidates percentage of votes from that county's turnout
* 4. Determine the winner, winnning vote count, and the winning percentage

#### Challenge Summary
---
The election commision could reuse the structure of this code again with any candidate or election type.The varaiables can be modified to match the circustances for the data being collected and the csv dataset iformation would need to mofified so that it can be implemented in the code. This will allow the code to run in a similar fashion. Using the few modifications and the structure of the code, it would produce the correct numbers and percentages for the election of choice.
